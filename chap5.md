##A claim/ premise is acceptable because

1. It is supported by an argument
2. It is supported by an argument elsewhere
3. It is known through itself 
4. Common knowledge (not only true, but must be seen as true by others)
5. Testimony - Someone said itI saw my wife this morning, 
6. Authority - An expert said it
7. TOBE CONTINUED

##When Premises are Acceptable

Premises Supported by a Cogent Subargument
* A premise in an argument is acceptable if the arguer has already shown it to be acceptable by a cogent subargument 

Premise is Supported Else where
* Premise is Supported by a cogent argument Else where

Premises known a priori to be ture
* Some claims must simply be acceptable in their own right if arguments are to get off the ground
* A priori: from the first, something that is known to be true or false
(The contrasting term a posteriori means “ from something that is posterior, or afterward ” and refers to claims that are knowable only after, or on the basis of, experience. 
* Another word for a posteriori is empirical; an empirical claim is one that can be known only on the basis of evidence about the experienced world.)

Common Knowledge
*  That is to say, if the premise states something that is known by virtually everyone, it should be allowed as an acceptable premise.

Testimony  
* Under some conditions a claim is accceptable on th ebasis of a peron's testimoney
* A  person testifies or tells about something he or she has experienced. Under certain conditions, we accept the claim about the expereine as decribed

Unreliability of Person or Source

* Caused by lying
* Poor hearing conditions 

Failure to Restirct Claim to Experience and Competence

* Claim can't go beyond personal experence
* Can't claim  lecture is dynamic by only going to one lecture

Proper Authority
* Arguemnts are put forward by people who possess specialized knowledge about the subject
* Such a person wuold be an expert or authority in this area

1. Expert X has asserted claim P.
2. X is a reliable and credible person in this context.
3. P falls within area of specialization K.
4. K is a genuine area of knowledge.
5. X is an expert, or authority, in K.
6. The experts in K agree about P.
Therefore,
7. P is acceptable.

Faulty Appearls to authority
* If any of these conditions are not met, an appeal to authority does not provide relevant and sufficient grouns to support a claim. The R and G conditions will not be met and the argument will not be cogent

Accepting Premises Provisionally
* If the argument passes on R and G, then on the basis of provisional acceptance of premises. you can provisonally accept the conclusion 

##Easy Refutability

* The exception proves/confirms the rule
* Claims know a priori to be false
 * Claims can be refutability if the priori is a false with the use of a counter example
* Inconsistnecy between the premises
* Vagueness or ambiguity
* Fallacy of begging question
 *  Is a logical fallacy in which the writer or speaker assumes the statement under examination to be true. In other words, begging the question involves using a premise to support itself.
 * Point of departure is same as part of arrival
 * God exists because it says so in the biblex`

Easy refutability
To refute a claim is to show that it is false. Some premises can easily be retured
Usering a counterexample is enough to show that it is false
Claims can be refuted when they are contradicted by experience, testimony, authority or common knowledge

Claim Known a Priori to be false
We have seen that some claims can be known a priori to be true>
In an analogous way, some claims can be known a priori to be false
Any such claim is unacceptable and cannot server as a premise in a cogent argument

Inconsistency between Premises
Sometimes an argument will contain a number of premises, seveal of which will explicitly or implicity contradict each other.
It is more common for premises to contradict each other implicitly. 

Vagueness or Ambiguity
Vagueness or ambiguity can sometimes render premises unacceptable. 
Terms like depression, widepread, and young are all vague in this context. Unless their meaning is clarified, the claim in which they are used will be unacceptable

The Fallacy of Begging the Question
An argument can go wrong because the preise is not more acceptable than the conclusion.
Other names include circularity or circular reason
Example: God exists because it says so in the bible
Problem is point of depature is point of arrival

Summary of Acceptability of Premises
1. It is supported by a subargument that is cogent
2. It is cogently supported elsewhere by tje arguer or another person, and this fact is noted 
3. It is known a priori to be true.
4. It is a matter of common knowledge.
5. It is supported by appropriate testimony. (That is, the claim is not implausible, the
sources are not unreliable, and the claim is restricted in content to the experience and
competence of the person who asserts it.)
6. It is supported by an appropriate appeal to authority.
*7. It is not known to be unacceptable and can serve provisionally as the basis for
argument.

Summary of Unacceptability Conditions
1. One or more premises are refutable on the basis of common knowledge, a priori knowledge, or reliable knowledge from testiomoney or authority
2. One or more premises are a priori false
3. Several premises taken together produce a contradiction, so that the premises are explicity or implicity inconsistent
4. One or more premises are vauge or ambiguous to such an extent that it is not possible to determine what sort of evidence would establish them as acceptable or unacceptable.
5. One or more premises would not be rationally acceptable to any person who did not already accept the conclusion. In this case the arguments begs the question or is circular
