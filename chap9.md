Induction to Deduction
Particular to gneral


All arg (A) can have implicit particular (B)
Syllogisms(C) are args (A)

Syllogisms (C) can have implicit particular (B)

( B (A )) and ( A (C )) thus (B (A ( C)))


This bird that I saw has feather
The other bird that I saw has a feather
etc
Therefore, Birds have feathers

IN inductions we dont look at all cases, only a subset, but we feel justified to make a justification on all


EXERCISE 1: PART A
Comment on sample selection techniques for the following issues. If you think the technique, or the situation, will result in an unrepresentative sample being used as the basis for an inductive generalization, suggest ways in which the sample could be made more representative.

*1. Joe wants to understand whether and how difficulties in finding employment are affecting recent high school graduates in his home state of Wisconsin. He puts a notice on job search bulletin boards in two major cities, giving his phone number and asking people who are willing to be interviewed to contact him.

Poor people might not have phnes, also in rurel areas

*3. A naturalist is employed to estimate the population of elk in an area of a national park. He begins by finding reports of sightings on four major hiking trails and at two major campsites. He calculates that the area covered is about one-tenth of the total area of the park; the chance of an elk being seen over a one-year period, given the use rate of the park, he calculates at 10 percent. There were 20 sightings of elk; hence he estimates the elk population in the area at 2,000.

U might be seeing the same elk
assuming elk density is the same

*5 Professor X teaches a compulsory course in agricultural history for history majors, and he has 100 students. Professor Y teaches an optional course in women ’ s history, and she has 60 students. On student evaluations, 60 percent of Professor X ’ s students complain about his course, saying they find it difficult and do not like the assignments and the textbooks. By contrast, only 10 percent of Professor Y ’ s students did not like her course. Fully 80 percent rated her as very good or excellent and found the assignments and texts helpful. The remaining 10 percent rated Professor Y as good.

EXERCISE 1: PART B
Using your own background knowledge, comment on the variability you would expect in the following populations, mentioning some of the main respects in which you would expect the population to vary, relevant to the aspect being studied.

*2. Situations of junior high school teachers of sex education in religious schools in North America. (Focus: strategies for addressing religious diversity among students)

*4. Sea otters in the waters along the west coast of North America. (Focus: evidence, if any, that pollutants in the water, from the growing human population, are adversely affecting the sea otters ’ health)


For each of the following passages 
(a) state whether there is an inductive generalization. If so,
(b) identify the sample and the target population and then 
(c) assess the inductive strength of the argument by commenting on the adequacy of the sample. 
(d) If several claims are supported by the evidence, distinguish them and, when relevant, comment on whether these
claims are supported equally well by the evidence offered.


(a)	
(b) sample is strongly politically opinated american men, population is american population
(c) poor inductive strength, small sample pool that doesn't fully represent the target population
(d)

induction -> particualr to general case + invalidity
deduction -> general to particular case + validity 

so sorta
induction =/= formally invalid arg
deduction(syllogism) =/= arg that is formally valid

### Valid syllogism

inductive arguments
* inductive generalizations 
* statistical Syllogisms


Pattern reducing

1.
most A are B
x is A
Therefore x is B (likely)

2.
few A are B
x is A
Therefore x is (likely) not B

Most A are not B
x is A
Therefore x is not B (likely)


Study:

Fallacy of the biased sample:
The sample is selected in such a way that it is bound either to underemphasize or to overemphasize the characteristic being studied

Fallacy of hasty generalizaiton: 
an argument in which the sample is hopelessly inadequate, so that the inference from the sample to the population is not reliable

Fallacy of anecdotal evidence:
Arguments in which there is an attempt to base an inductive generalization on a story or anecdote are often said to be anecdotal arguments. 

Fallacy of composition:
A conclusion about a whole or group is reached on the basis of premises about its parts or members. The reasoning goes from the smaller unit to the larger one, or, as is often said, from the micro level to the macro level.

In the fallacy of division, 
a conclusion about a part, or member, is reached on the basis of premises about the whole, or group. The reasoning goes from the larger unit to the smaller one



##3/27/2017

syllogimsm =/= general -> particular
inductive generalization =/= particular -> general
argument by analogy =/= particular case -> particular case


The fallacies of composition and division ignore the fact that, often, a whole is something over and above the sum of its parts; the whole involves, in addition to parts, aspects added due to relationships and structure.

Analogue

arguments by analogy

Planet X has an atmosphere
Earth has an atmosphere

There, PLanet X harbours life

Earth has an atmosphere


A is very intelligent
DB is very intelligent (DB is an AI)
A has alot of doubts 
BD has a lot of  doubts

This doesn't work because intelligent means different things in different context (human intellgient. vs intelligent of software)
