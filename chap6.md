Straw Man fallacy
- A kind of irrelevence
- If you criticize a weak position that an author did not really hold and infer from your criticism that his real position flawed, you have committed a straw man fallacy

Ad hominem fallacy
- Another kind of irrelevence
- A critic attacks is one in which a crtic attacks a person instead of arguing against the claims that person has put forwards
- Although debating tatics are almost alway mistakes as far as logic is concered, they sometimes influence debate more then they should
- Implicity we ar ereplying on ad hominem considerations when we reject a presentation because the person making it does not look presentable, middle class, or when we are skeptical of a view because those who hold it are young and do not hold responsible jobs
