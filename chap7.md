#Categorical Syllogism

##Four Categorical form


**Categorical logic: **

In this argument, both premises and conclusion are in categorical form. That is, they are statements in which a *subject category* is connected to *a predicate category*. The first statement makes a universal affirmation, whereas the second two state universal
negations.

*Subject*: what of which something is said
*Predicate*: that which is said of something

Example: Paul eats.
* Paul is the subject
* Eats is the predicate

Example: Paul eats his soup.
* Paul is the subject
* Eats his soup is the predicate

Example: The TV that I like was on last night.
* The TV that I like is the subject
* was on last night his soup is the predicate

We decided to make the next step by reating a process for reaching that end
* We the subject
* decided to make the next step by reating a process for reaching that end the predicate

There are perople who dont like soup
* Some people are the subject
* Who don't dont like soup is the predicate
another way
* people who don't like soup is the subect
* they exist is the predicate


Universal Affirmation: A
All S are Ps
* All members of the S category ar eincluded within the P category
* Example All sisters are female persons

Particular Affirmation: I
Some S are P
* Some Member of the S category are incuded in the P category 
* Some sisters are Pianists

Universal Negation: E
No S are P
* All members of the S category are excluded from the P category 
* No sisters are male

Particular Negation : O
Some S are not P
* Some members of S category are excluded from the P category
* Some sisters are not pianists

Examples of manipulation:
Only catholics can become pope 
* Some people who are catholics can become pope (I)

Not all politicans are crooks
* Some politicans are not crooks (O)


All departments did not file a report
* No department filed a report (E) 

Some Students work hard (I or O) but for the purpose of this course should be (I)
* you could also understand this as some students don't work hard, its the context or tone that change it

All Dogs are animals (A)

The ears of a hourse indicates its moods (A)


EXERCISE 1
(a) Translate the following sentences into categorical form and state which of the four forms — A, E, I, O— you have used. Be prepared to defend your answer. (b) If you think that any sentence is ambiguous as to which of the categorical forms it exemplifies, say so and explain why. Note: The point here is not to consider whether the statements made are true or false, acceptable or unacceptable, but merely to write them in categorical form as A, E, I, or O.

are called rose. 

(Hint: Complete the predicate term.)
20. Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.


Reductions 

distribution{
	distributed = taken universally
	
	Subject + Predicate

	Subject: Some whales
	Prdicate: are mammals 
}


A (All S are P)
	Subject: All whales
	Predicate: are mammals (not distributed, whales are not all the mammals)

E (No S are P)
	Subject: No whales
	Predicate: is a fish (is distributed)

I (Some S are P)
	Subject: Some whales 
	Predicate: Eat meat (not distributed, whales are not all the meat eaters)

O (Some S are not P)
	Subject: Some whales
	Predicate: are not blue (is distributed)

But Note 
All triangles are three-sided, two dimensional figures
- Is distribued (even though its A) since all 3 sided 2 dimeional are triangles

Conversion

A (true)
All S are P

or

All X are Y -> Some Y are X
All whares are mammals -> some mammals are whales

Interesting thing to consider

A -> I'
all students are hardworkings

I -> I'
some students are hardworking

E -> E'
O -> O' is not necessarily true

// he will not as questions about contraposition nor obversion

##Categorical Syllogism

"Whats feed their young because they are a type of mammals and mammals feed their young."

Therefore, all whales are things that feed their young

- So you cannot be a whale that does not feed its young (All P are in S)

minor term - subject of the conclusion
major term - predicate of the conclusions
middle term -



1. All things that are laughter are things that are the best medicine. 
(A) Obverse: No things that are laughter are things that are not the best medicine. (E)

3. Some things that are technical innovations are not things that are needed. 
(O) Obverse is: Some things that are technical innovations are things that are not needed.

5. Some professors are not persons who are impractical. 
(O) Obverse is: Some professors are persons who are not impractical.

7. All things that are revenge are things that are sweet. 
(A) Obverse: No things that are revenge are things that are not sweet.

8. All things that are love are things that are blind.
(A) Obverse: No things that are love are things that are non-blind.

10. All rules are things that require interpretation. (A)
Obverse: No rules are things that do not require interpretation.


EXERCISE 2: PART B
1. All U are E. A statement. 
Converse: All E are U; not equivalent. 
Contrapositive: All non-E are non-U; equivalent to original. 
The original is an A statement; so too are the converse and the contrapositive.

4. All M are R. A statement. 
Converse: All R are M; not equivalent to original. 
Contrapositive: All non-R are non-M. Equivalent to original. 
Original is an A statement; so too are the converse and the contrapositive.

6. Some P are C. I statement. 
Converse: Some C are P; equivalent to original. 
Contrapositive: some non-C are non-P; not equivalent to original. 
The original is an I statement; so too are the converse and the contrapositive.

1. Some A are U. I statement. 
Contradictory of this statement: No A are U. 
The statement and its contradictory must have opposite truth values.

3. Some L are F. I statement. 
Contradictory of this statement is No L are F, which is an E statement.

5. All S are F. A statement. 
Contradictory of this statement is Some S are not F, which is an O statement.

##Distribution of Terms

A term is distributed, in a categorical statement, if that statement says something about everything that is in the category that the term refers to.

Rulese of Categorial Syllogism

#3/15/2017

1.
= Any law that **degrades personality** is unjust
= All segregation **distorts the soul + damages the personality** 
Therefore, all segregation statues is unjust

2.
All people who can... quilts is a princes..
She is someone who can ... quilts
Therefore, shes a princess

3
= (No person who believes that only matter exists is someone who..... soul)
= All materialists are people that believe that only matter exists
Therefore, no materialist sis someone who believse in the soul

= All things that exists are made of batter
= no soul is made out of matter
Therefore, no soul is a thing that exists 

Side note

All arguments can have implicit parts
(all syllogisms can have implict parts)


4.
= All things that thinks exists
= I think
Therefore, I exists

5
= All people who accept a pardon
= Nixon accepted the pardon
THerefore nixon is guilty 

6
= No crook buys peat moss
= the lady buys peat moss 
Therefore, the lady is not a crook 


Enthymeme
sorites 

9
All lions are big cats
= All big cats are preadtors
= All lions are big cats
Therefore 	**=all lions are preadators**
			=all preadtors are carnivoers
			Therefore all lions are carnivoers
