Examine the following passages to determine whether they contain arguments. For those pas-
sages that do contain arguments, rewrite them in standardized form, numbering premises and
conclusion

*1. If a car has reliable brakes, it has brakes that work in wet weather. The brakes on my car
don ’ t work very well in wet weather. You can see that my car does not have reliable
brakes.

**Is an argument**

*3. When unemployment among youth goes up, hooliganism and gang violence go up too. You
can see from this evidence that unemployment is probably a major cause of these disrup-
tions. Therefore people who say gang violence is caused by drugs have got it all wrong.

**An argument**

Assume that each of the following passages represents an argument. Identify the premises and
the conclusion. For all cases where there is more than one premise, indicate whether you think
the premises are linear, linked, or convergent in the way they are supposed to support the

Knowledge:
*Linear*:Linear structure A structure in which there is a sequence of subarguments, each with one premise. That is to say, (1) is put forward to support (2), (2) to support (3), (3) to support (4) and so on, until we reach the final conclusion.
*Linked*: Linked premises can support the conclusion in the argument only when they are taken together; no single premise will give any support to the conclusion without the others.
*Example of linked*:
1. Vulnerability to heart disease is either inherited or environmental.
2. Vulnerability to heart disease is not environmental.
2. Vulnerability to heart disease is inherited 
*Convergent*: When the support is of the convergent type, each premise states a separate reason that the arguer thinks is relevant
to the conclusion. In these cases, premises are not linked and are not interdependent in the sense that each one could support the conclusion without the others
*Example of Convergent*:
1. Setting aside apartments for adults and keeping out children discriminates against people with children.
2. Setting aside apartments for adults and keeping out children encourages single, childless people to pursue an overly selfish lifestyle.
Therefore,
3. Apartments should not keep children out.

Unstated Premises:
*Unstated Conclusion*: A conclusion not put into words but suggested by the context, wording, and natural logical order of a passage. Note: Unstated conclusions should be added only when there is a clear interpretive justification for doing so.
