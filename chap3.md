Standardizing and Argument

Premise 1
Premise 2
Premise N

Therefore,
Conclusion

To standardize and argument is to set out its premise and conclusion in clear statements, with the premises preceding the conclusion. By numbering the presmies and the conclusions we can refer to specific statements in an efficient way.

We can simply refer to (1) or premise (1) instead of copyiing out all the words

Subarguments

Arguments ofthen procedd in stages, a statemnet that serves as a premise in one argument becomes the conclusion in another sugarguments.

Subarguments maybe given to defined premises

A subargument is a subordinate argument that is component of a larger argument which can be called **whole argument**

###Use and Mention

When we mention in this example, we put quotation marks aroudn that work

When we use we use it normally

* Maria called, "Out"
* Marian called out

###Emotionally Charged Language
aka loaded language

Through the use of emotionally charged language, a mood and attitude can be set without providing arguments, reasons or any considerations of alternate possibilities. Consider, for example, the difference between calling a change a "diversion of funds" and calling it a"reform"

###Euphenisms
Is the opposite of emotionally charged language

Euphenisms: on the other hand, involves a kind of whitewashing effect in which descriptions are less emotional than appropriate. 
* If a video store advertises tapes as“ pre-enjoyed ” ; that is a euphemism for “ secondhand. ”
* Bland, abstract, polite language is often used to refer to things that would be found embarrassing, demeaning, appalling, or horrible.
* Euphemistic language functions to desensitize us, to dull our awareness of such things.

##Ambiguity
Does 1, 2 imply 3
1. Grandma is sick
2. Fishing is not what it used to be, 
Therefore
3. Hotdogs are bettwe with ketchup

Well its because the two premieses having nothing to do with the conclusion.

Example of correct reasoning
1. Someone breathing is alive
2. joe is breathing, 
Therefore
3. joes is alive

It looks like the 3 sentences has something to do with each other, reoccuring ideas (notions) such as Joe, and breathing and being alive

There are two types of ambiguity

Semantic ambiguity

When we only read the headline, we do not have enough information to guide us to which meaning is intended, so the headline is ambiguous. This is an example of semantic ambiguity.

Example
* He could not spot the city on his map.
 * Spot as in see or find
* There was an ugly green spot on her shirt. 
 *  it refers to a mark on the shirt, presumably one that is dirt or soil and should not be there.

Syntatic ambiguity
* Other ambiguities are due to the structure of phrases or sentences — to the way words are put together. These ambiguities are called syntactic.

They arise because a phrase or sentence can quite naturally be interpreted as expressing two or more distinct gram  matical structures. 

Example
* A common cause of syntactic ambiguity is careless writing. An example of syntactic ambiguity is the previously mentioned headline “ Time for Football and Meatball Stew. ”
 * Here, word order, meaning, and reasonable charity in interpretation all indicate that the word meatball in this headline should describe the stew. There isnt football in the stew
 
Fallacy of equivocation 
*  A fallacy is a mistaken argument or step in argument that is often not noticed and, as a result, appears with some frequency. 
* The fallacy of equivocation is committed when a key word in an argument is used in two or more senses and the premises of the argument appear to support its conclusion only because these senses are not distinguished from each other. 
* We may fail to notice the shift in meaning, and for that reason think that the argument is more cogent than it is

1. Micah White is an atheist.
2. All atheists lack beliefs.
So,
3. Micah White lacks beliefs.
4. Anyone who lacks beliefs cannot be persecuted for his beliefs.
Therefore,
5. Micah White cannot be persecuted for his beliefs

**Vagueness**
Vagueness, which is a lack of distinctness of meaning, is another example of lack of clarity. The problem of vagueness arises when a word, as used, has a meaning that is indeterminate, or fuzzy, and as such is not sufficiently clear to convey the necessary information in that context of use.

Types of Definition

Essential definition
* The esssence of something
* A list of all characteristics which are each necessary and collectively sufficient to identify all of the things to which the defined word apply, while not including any things which do not. Many people use the phrase "necessary and sufficient" as a benchmark for remembering what an essential definition is. 


Lexical definition
* If you look up the word chair in a dictionary, you will find an account of the various meanings of that word as it is commonly used by speakers of English. These are thedenotations of the word.
* A reportive definition has the goal of accurately describing how a word is used by explaining its meaning in a clear way, referring to important properties of the things it describes. Reportive definitions are also called lexical definitions.
* These definitions are intended to capture the literal meaning or denotation of a word. They normally do not seek to explain figurative or metaphorical meanings.
* Layman definition not by experts

Stipulative definition
* A stipulative definition is one in which someone specifies what the usage of a word is to be. 
* In stipulating a definition, the person who puts it forward seeks to set out a specific usage for some purpose. He or she does not seek to describe ordinary usage, as in a reportive or lexical definition. Rather, the person sets out a meaning for a term.
* An example of a stipulative definition is “ For the purposes of this award, the expression full-time student shall mean any student enrolled in eight or more semester-length courses in a given calendar year. ” 
* We can easily imagine such a definition being stated in the context of a description of a scholarship. It stipulates, or sets out, how the expressionfull-time student is to be used in establishing eligibility for the award.

Ostensive definition
* In an ostensive definition of a word, X, we explain what X means by pointing to an example of X. Instead of using words to say what “mango” means, we might just point to a mango and say, “ That ’ s a mango, ” or, still better, have the person taste a piece of mango. 


Operational definition
* Operational definitions are a type of stipulative definition. They are most commonly used in the process of scientific study, when it is necessary to define an abstract word in terms of concrete experience. 
* The purpose of an operational definition is to specify a set of operations, or procedures that will be used to determine whether the word applies. 
* For example, an operational definition of soluble is: “ A substance is soluble if, and only if, it dissolves when placed in water.
* you make a grilled cheese by...

Persuasive definition
* A persuasive definition is a stipulative definition disguised as a claim or as a reportive definition. 
* In a persuasive definition there is an attempt to change attitudes by keeping the emotional connotations of a word while altering its application. 
* Persuasive definitions attempt to alter our attitudes and beliefs by redefining terms instead of stating reasons and arguments.
* Terms such as real, true, authentic, and genuine are often elements of persuasive definitions.
