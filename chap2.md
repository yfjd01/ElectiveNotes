Argument Patterns

We have seen premise -> conclusion
* What we will see is premise -> premise -> conclusion
* The reason which we need more premise for an argument is to stregthen it

General Strategies for Standardizing Arguments
1. Read the passage carefully 
2. Confirm that the passge you are dealing with actually contains the argument
3. Idenfity the main conclusion
4. Omit any material that serves purely as side comment
5. Omit materials that you havealready included
6. Omit such personal phrases 
7. Numbereach premise and conculsion
8. check that each premise and conclusion is a self-contained complete statement
9. Check that no premise or conclusion itself expresses an agrument

Prof Note Aside: X is A, There fore X is B

We cant make this argument unless we know A implies B
* Example X is breathing, therefore X is alive
* Someone breathing is alive
