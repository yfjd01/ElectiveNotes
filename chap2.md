##Chapter 2 Argument Patterns

We have seen premise -> conclusion
* What we will see is premise -> premise -> conclusion
* The reason which we need more premise for an argument is to stregthen it

General Strategies for Standardizing Arguments
1. Read the passage carefully 
2. Confirm that the passge you are dealing with actually contains the argument
3. Idenfity the main conclusion
4. Omit any material that serves purely as side comment
5. Omit materials that you havealready included
6. Omit such personal phrases 
7. Numbereach premise and conculsion
8. check that each premise and conclusion is a self-contained complete statement
9. Check that no premise or conclusion itself expresses an agrument

Prof Note Aside: X is A, There fore X is B

We cant make this argument unless we know A implies B
* Example X is breathing, therefore X is alive
* Someone breathing is alive

Convergent Support: A kind of suupport where premises work together in a cumulative way to support the conclusion, but are not linked. The bearing of one premise on the conclusion would be unaffected if the other premises were removed, however the argument is strengthend when the premises are considered together, since more evidence is then offered

CounterExample: A case that refutes a universal statement

Degree of commitment: (to conclusion): Level of commitment on the part of the arguer to the conclusion that her or she is putting forward, the arguer may claim confidently that some thing in the case or may indicate some degree of tentativeness by saying that it is probably the case, may be the case or could be the case.

Divergent pattern of argument: A pattern of support in which a single premise is used to support two distrinct conclusions

Linear Structure: A structure in which there is a sequence of subarguments , each with one premise. THat is to say 1 is put forwatds to support 2, 2 to support 3 4 to support 4 until we reach the final conclusion.

Linked Support: A kind of support where premises are interdependent in their support for a conclusion. When premises are linked the removal of one would affect the bearing of the other upon the conclusion.

Main conclusion: The main claim defended in an argument that contains subarguments

Missing, or unstated, premiseL A premise not stated in just so many words but suggested by the context, working and natrual logical order of a paggage and needed to fill a gap in the reasoning
Note: missing presmises should be supplied only when there is a clear interpretive justification in doing so

Qualified or tentative conclusion: Conclusions sated in such a way that it is reasonable to attribute less thant a high degree of commitment to the arguer

Rhetorical question: Question posed anticipating a particular answer. A rhetorical question is not a request for information, rather it is a way of expressing a claim. Premises or conclusions or arguemnts are sometimes stated in rhetorical questions.

Scope (of a premise or conclusion): Quantity of memebers of a group to which the claim is intended to apply. Scope is indicated by such words as all, none, most, many , some and a few

Standardizing an arguemnt: Identifying the conclusion and premises of an argument from a passage and setting them up in a format with premises arranged in logical order, subarguments indicated, and the conclusion at the end. All premises and conclusions should appear as complete statements.

Subarguemtns. A smaller argument within a larger one, in which a premise of a main argument is itself defended

Unstateded or missing conclusion. A conclusion not put into words but suggestd by the context, wording and natural order of a passage.

Whole argument: Arguemnt for a main conclusion, including all subarguments used to support any premises.
