###Lectures 1: Reasoning 
making arguments

You should vote for me, because I'll make america great again
**Acts of Reasoning, aka an Argument:** because I'll make america great again
Proposition: Great?

Having scored the most points, Gretzky must be considered the greatest hockey played
**Argument**: Having scored the most points
**Proposition**: Greatest

Lying goes against the social nature of the human being, and for that reason it is morally bad.
**Argument**: Lying goes against the social nature of the human being
What is a Proposition?


Opinions \implies firm(er) knowledge

**Opinions**
* Everyone is entitled to an opinion
* But not everyones option is equally correct
* Not every opion is equally as right as another one
* Argument: It does not matter if our opinions are backed up by arguments or by good reason because anyway there is no truth

---  
##Lec 2

Difference between
* **Claims**: The Earth  is flat
* **Statements**: The Earth  is flat TODO: Mark the difference
* **Declarative Sentences**: I think the Earth is Flat

* **Premise**: Point of departure 
* **Conclusion**: Point of arrival

'{X Should bbe disqualified as a candidate}, [because he refused to publish his tax returns]'

'{} conclusion'

'[] premise'

An argument has both a premise and a conculsion, you cant have a conclusion without a premise

In this example the premise came after the conclusion

**The Foundation**: Something known, the knowledge, the foundation of the logical order of reason, although the premise physically comes after the conclusion in this example, the logical order is premise comes before conclusion

```
T refused to publish his tax return. Therefore he 
    should be disqualified as a candidate
```
Here the chronological order is the same as the logical order

1. If you kill your neighbour, you will be sent to jail
 * This is not an argument because there is no preimise nor there is a conclusion
 * Not a statement because its "If" (implying true or false), you are not stating anything, you are not thinking of something that is the truth
 * This is a conditional statement
2. IF it is raining tonight, then I guess the ground will be wet tomorrow 
 * The difference between 1 and 2 is the context, in 1 it is not as obvious as 2 as in 2 we have the information that the ground is going to be wet after it rains (It is something that is obvious)
 * The "knowing premise", This is an argument
 
Causal Explanation

* Last night's rain made the ground wet
* It rained yesterday. It rained all morning. This is why the ground is wet


Making an arguments, It doesn't work like this:
```
1. It rained y
2. It rained x
Therefore 3. the ground is wet..
```
This is not the same as making an argument
* Heres something that we know
* heres what I am allowed to refer, casuality doesnt refect reality
* In reasoning a certain thing that i think, causes me to think something else


##Lec 3

Arguments: have a casuation?
"The ground is all wet. That is because it rained last night"

Sherlock Holems trying to determine what the weatehr was yesterday in a place where he just landed
"Hmmm... The ground is all wet. That means it rained last night."

Sherlock Holems, not having left his hotel room yet one morning and replying to Watson who says he hopes they can have a picnic for breakfast: "Don't be silly Watson, I', sure the ground is all weat since it rained last night."

Definition: I think something is true so there in consequence something else must be true

Example of a command: 
"Lying is bad, therefore don't lie"

TODO: Chapter 1 Exercises

**Argument:** A set of claims put forward as offering support for a further claim. An argument is composed of the supporting claims and the suppoerted claim. A person offers an argument when he or she tries to justify a claim by offering reasons for it.

**Conclusion:** In an argument, the claim for which premises are intended as support. It is this claim that the arguer tries to make credible.

**Conditional statement:** A conditional statement a connection is asserted between a condition and something said to be dependent on it. An example of a condtional statment is "If it snows, we will shovel the sidewalk" Note that this statement does not assert that it is snowning but only that if it snows, shoveling will be done. A conditional statemnet, by itseld does not constitue an argument, altough conditional statements are often used as argumentts 

**Explanation:** An account showing or attemping to show how it came to be that a fact or an event is the way it is.
Frequently explanations are given by specifiying the causes of an eveny. An explanation is one kind of nonargument

**Indicator words:** "For, since, thus, therefore and because" used in arguments to indicate that a person is reasoning from premise to conclusion. However these words appear in not only arguments

**Nonargumnet:** A passage or speech that does not contain an argument

**Opinion:** A belief typically about a matter open to dispute, where there is not full proof and others have different ideas. Often people are aware that their opinions are not fully backed up by evidence and hold less firmly to them than to other belifers for which there is more conclsuive evidence.

**Premise:** A supporting reason in an argument. It is put forward as being acceptable and provding rational support for futher claim.
