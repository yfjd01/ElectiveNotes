##ARG Condition

Acceptable Premise
 * It has acceptable premise. That is, it is reasonable for those to whorm the argument is addressed to believe these premies. There is good reason to accept the premise. Even if, in some cases, they are not known to be true. and there is no good evidence indicating the premise is false	
 * (1. All plumbers are corrupt)
 * 2. Helmut is a plumber
 * 3. Therefore, Helmut is corrupt

Relevant premise (Premise is relevant to its conclusion)
 * The premise are relevant to its conclusion. By this we mean that the premise state evidence, offer reasons that support the conclusion, or can be arranged into a demonstration from which the concluson can be derived. The relevance of premise is necessary for the cogency of an argument
* What does being a plumber have to do, specifically, with being corrupt? At first sight, anyway, there seems to be no reason to link being a plumber to corruption than being just about any other human trait (tall, grey-haired, German, ill-tempered, etc.). It seems that, if we are looking for premises that will prove that Helmut is corrupt, we should probably look elsewhere. ( I guess these arguments are not really relevent)


Good Groups 
 * Good grounds for the conclusion. In other words, considered together, the premise give sufficient reason to make it rational to accept the conclusion
 * (1. Some plumbers are corrupt)
 * 2. Helmut is a plumber
 * 3. Therefore, Helmut is corrupt.
