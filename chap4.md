##ARG Condition

Acceptable Premise
 * It has acceptable premise. That is, it is reasonable for those to whorm the argument is addressed to believe these premies. There is good reason to accept the premise. Even if, in some cases, they are not known to be true. and there is no good evidence indicating the premise is false	
 * (1. All plumbers are corrupt)
 * 2. Helmut is a plumbers
 * 3. Therefore, Helmut is corrupt

Relevant premise (Premise is relevant to its conclusion)
 * The premise are relevant to its conclusion. By this we mean that the premise state evidence, offer reasons that support the conclusion, or can be arranged into a demonstration from which the concluson can be derived. The relevance of premise is necessary for the cogency of an argument
* What does being a plumber have to do, specifically, with being corrupt? At first sight, anyway, there seems to be no reason to link being a plumber to corruption than being just about any other human trait (tall, grey-haired, German, ill-tempered, etc.). It seems that, if we are looking for premises that will prove that Helmut is corrupt, we should probably look elsewhere. ( I guess these arguments are not really relevent)


Good Groups 
 * Good grounds for the conclusion. In other words, considered together, the premise give sufficient reason to make it rational to accept the conclusion
 * (1. Some plumbers are corrupt)
 * 2. Helmut is a plumber
 * 3. Therefore, Helmut is corrupt.


Acceptability of premises (A Condition)
* A condition in which the premises of an argument are reaonable and believe

**Acceptability of Premises (A condition)**: Condition in which the premises of an argument are reasonable to believe.

**Analogy:** Comparison based on significiant resemblance between that cases that are compared. When the premises are conneted to the conclusion on the basis of an analogy.

ARG conditions: Conditions of a cogent argument. The premises must: (1) be acceptable, (2) be relevant to the conclusion, and (3) when considered togerther, provide sufficient grounds for the conclusion. For an argument to be cogen, all ARG condtions must be satisfied.

ARG Conditions of a cogent argument. The premises must (1) be acceptable (2) be relevent to the conclusion and (3) when considered together, provide sufficient grounds for the conclusion. For an argument to be cogent all ARG conditions must be satisified.

Cogent Argument: Argument in which the presmies are rationally acceptable and also properly connected to the conclusion. There are properly connected if they are relevant to the conclusion and, considered togetehr, provide good grounds for it

**Conductive argument:** Argument in which premises (typically several in numbers) are put forward to support a conclusion convergently. 

**Dedeductive entailment**: Most complete relationship of logical support if and only if one statement entails another, then it is possible for the second statement to be false when the first statement is true

Deductive validity: Characteristic of an argument in which the presmies deductively entail the conclusion. In a deductively valid argumenet, it is **not possible for the conclusion to be false when the premises are true**

Dialectial context:  Context of controversy and discussion in which an argument of the conclusion about a disputed issue is formulated and put forward.

**Goodness of grounds (G condition)**: Sufficiency of premises to provide good reasosn or full evidence for the conclusion.
Premises offer sufficient gorunds if assuming that they are accepted, they would be relevant to the conclusion and sufficient to make it reasonable to accept that conclusion.

**Inductive support:**  **Support from experience to a conclusion about other experiences**, based on the assumption that relevant similarities in the world will persist. When there is inductive support, the premises do not deductively entail the conclusion

Rational Persuasion: Causing someone to come to believe a claim by putting forward good reasons, or a cogent argument on its behalf

**Relevance of premises (R Condition):** Premises of an argument are relevant to its conclusion provided that give at least some evidence or reasons in favour of the conclusion

Sound Argument in which premises are true and deductively entail the conclusion
