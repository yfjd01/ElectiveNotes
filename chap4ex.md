EXERCISE 1
For each of the following passages, state whether it contains an argument. If so, indicate the
conclusion and state whether the argument is based on **deductive entailment, conduction,**
**analogy, or induction**.

Required knowledge:
---
**Conductive argument:** Argument in which premises (typically several in numbers) are put forward to support a conclusion convergently. A + B => C 

**Dedeductive entailment**: Most complete relationship of logical support if and only if one statement entails another, then it is possible for the second statement to be false when the first statement is true. A <=> B => C can be false too where A <=> B => !C

**Inductive support:**  **Support from experience to a conclusion about other experiences** 

**Analogy:** Comparison based on significiant resemblance between that cases that are compared. When the premises are conneted to the conclusion on the basis of an analogy.

*1. He was angry. There were several things that showed it. He turned all red. He scowled.
He was clenching his fits. And when he talked to her, he was almost shouting.

**Conclusion was he was angry: condutive**


*2. If it snows, snow will cover the ice. And if the ice is covered, people won ’ t see it. Walking
on hidden ice is really dangerous for older people. Therefore, if it snows it will be
dangerous for older people.

**Therefore, if it snows it will be dangerous for older people., deductive argument**

*3. Beliefs are like apples in a basket. One rotten apple can contaminate a whole lot of others
in the same basket. Similarly, one false belief can contaminate a lot of other beliefs, and
make them unjustified. I conclude that a careful thinker should question all of her beliefs
to make sure none are false.  

**I conclude that a careful thinker should question all of her beliefs to make sure none are false.: analogy** 

*5. In a 2004 survey, 72 percent of the people surveyed in San Diego, California, reported
believing in life after death. Therefore, probably, more than two-thirds of people in the
state of California believe in life after death.

**Therefore, probably, more than two-thirds of people in the state of California believe in life after death.: Inductive**

*7. After World War II, the United States gave generously of funds and assistance to help with
the reconstruction of Europe, including that of Germany, which had been its enemy. It
generously aided another nation, Japan, in reconstruction. These efforts were successful. So
probably, efforts to reconstruct Iraq after the 2003 invasion will also be successful.

**So probably, efforts to reconstruct Iraq after the 2003 invasion will also be successful, Inductive argument**

*9. The argument has been made that God must exist because he is, by definition, perfect,
and existence is perfection, and if God didn ’ t exist, he would not be perfect. You can see
that this argument is flawed by constructing a parallel one, proving that a perfect island
exists. The argument would be: the perfect island has to exist, because otherwise it
wouldn ’ t be perfect. That parallel argument is flawed; you can ’ t prove by definition and
reason that a perfect island exists. Therefore, the original argument is flawed too. 

**Therefore, the original argument is flawed too.: deductive argument**

*11. Being opinionated is a very bad thing. First of all, a person who is opinionated is so
convinced of what he thinks that he is unable to learn anything new. And secondly, he is
likely to become very bad-tempered when people disagree with him. 

**Being opinionated is a very bad thing, conductive argument**
	
Exercise 2
For all arguments in the following examples, evaluate the argument using the ARG conditions
as you understand them from the introduction offered here. If the passage does not contain an
argument, there is no argument to evaluate; simply note that there is no argument and give
reasons for this answer. The first arguments are pre-standardized to make your work easier
---
**Acceptability of Premises (A condition)**: Condition in which the premises of an argument are reasonable to believe.

**Relevance of premises (R Condition):** Premises of an argument are relevant to its conclusion provided that give at least some evidence or reasons in favour of the conclusion

**Goodness of grounds (G condition)**: Sufficiency of premises to provide good reasosn or full evidence for the conclusion.
Premises offer sufficient gorunds if assuming that they are accepted, they would be relevant to the conclusion and sufficient to make it reasonable to accept that conclusion.

*4. The Philosophy Instructor Case
1. The textbooks selected for the philosophy course were difficult to read.
2. The assignments for the philosophy course were difficult to complete.
3. Many students do not enjoy studying philosophy.
Therefore,
4. The instructor in the philosophy course was not competent in his knowledge of philosophy.

*6. The Success of Technology Case
1. People thought an atomic bomb was impossible, and we made atomic bombs.
2. People thought flying machines were impossible, and we made airplanes.
3. People thought that landing a man on the moon was impossible, and we landed a
man on the moon.
4. People think getting an adequate vaccine against AIDS is impossible.
Therefore,
5. We will discover an adequate vaccine against AIDS.


Read the following dialogues. In each one, the first character gives an argument and the
second character responds to it. Find those cases in which the second character ’ s response
meets the challenge of argument and indicate that it does. Find those cases in which the second
character ’ s response does not meet this challenge and indicate that it does not. In each case,
explain the basis for your answer.
