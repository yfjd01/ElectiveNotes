###Lectures 1: Reasoning 
making arguments

You should vote for me, because I'll make america great again
**Acts of Reasoning, aka an Argument:** because I'll make america great again
Proposition: Great?

Having scored the most points, Gretzky must be considered the greatest hockey played
**Argument**: Having scored the most points
**Proposition**: Greatest

Lying goes against the social nature of the human being, and for that reason it is morally bad.
**Argument**: Lying goes against the social nature of the human being
What is a Proposition?


Opinions \implies firm(er) knowledge

**Opinions**
* Everyone is entitled to an opinion
* But not everyones option is equally correct
* Not every opion is equally as right as another one
* Argument: It does not matter if our opinions are backed up by arguments or by good reason because anyway there is no truth

---  
##Lec 2

Difference between
* **Claims**: The Earth  is flat
* **Statements**: The Earth  is flat TODO: Mark the difference
* **Declarative Sentences**: I think the Earth is Flat

* **Premise**: Point of departure 
* **Conclusion**: Point of arrival

'{X Should bbe disqualified as a candidate}, [because he refused to publish his tax returns]'

'{} conclusion'

'[] premise'

An argument has both a premise and a conculsion, you cant have a conclusion without a premise

In this example the premise came after the conclusion

**The Foundation**: Something known, the knowledge, the foundation of the logical order of reason, although the premise physically comes after the conclusion in this example, the logical order is premise comes before conclusion

```
T refused to publish his tax return. Therefore he 
    should be disqualified as a candidate
```
Here the chronological order is the same as the logical order

1. If you kill your neighbour, you will be sent to jail
 * This is not an argument because there is no preimise nor there is a conclusion
 * Not a statement because its "If" (implying true or false), you are not stating anything, you are not thinking of something that is the truth
 * This is a conditional statement
2. IF it is raining tonight, then I guess the ground will be wet tomorrow 
 * The difference between 1 and 2 is the context, in 1 it is not as obvious as 2 as in 2 we have the information that the ground is going to be wet after it rains (It is something that is obvious)
 * The "knowing premise", This is an argument
 
Causal Explanation

* Last night's rain made the ground wet
* It rained yesterday. It rained all morning. This is why the ground is wet


Making an arguments, It doesn't work like this:
```
1. It rained y
2. It rained x
Therefore 3. the ground is wet..
```
This is not the same as making an argument
* Heres something that we know
* heres what I am allowed to refer, casuality doesnt refect reality
* In reasoning a certain thing that i think, causes me to think something else


##Lec 3

Arguments: have a casuation?
"The ground is all wet. That is because it rained last night"

Sherlock Holems trying to determine what the weatehr was yesterday in a place where he just landed
"Hmmm... The ground is all wet. That means it rained last night."

Sherlock Holems, not having left his hotel room yet one morning and replying to Watson who says he hopes they can have a picnic for breakfast: "Don't be silly Watson, I', sure the ground is all weat since it rained last night."

Definition: I think something is true so there in consequence something else must be true

Example of a command: 
"Lying is bad, therefore don't lie"

Chapter 2

Argument Patterns

We have seen premise -> conclusion
* What we will see is premise -> premise -> conclusion
* The reason which we need more premise for an argument is to stregthen it

General Strategies for Standardizing Arguments
1. Read the passage carefully 
2. Confirm that the passge you are dealing with actually contains the argument
3. Idenfity the main conclusion
4. Omit any material that serves purely as side comment
5. Omit materials that you havealready included
6. Omit such personal phrases 
7. Numbereach premise and conculsion
8. check that each premise and conclusion is a self-contained complete statement
9. Check that no premise or conclusion itself expresses an agrument

Prof Note Aside: X is A, There fore X is B

We cant make this argument unless we know A implies B
* Example X is breathing, therefore X is alive
* Someone breathing is alive

Chapter 3

Standardizing and Argument

Premise 1
Premise 2
Premise N

Therefore,
Conclusion

To standardize and argument is to set out its premise and conclusion in clear statements, with the premises preceding the conclusion. By numbering the presmies and the conclusions we can refer to specific statements in an efficient way.

We can simply refer to (1) or premise (1) instead of copyiing out all the words

Subarguments

Arguments ofthen procedd in stages, a statemnet that serves as a premise in one argument becomes the conclusion in another sugarguments.

Subarguments maybe given to defined premises

A subargument is a subordinate argument that is component of a larger argument which can be called **whole argument**

###Use and Mention

When we mention in this example, we put quotation marks aroudn that work

When we use we use it normally

Maria called, "Out"
Marian called out

###Emotionally Charged Language
aka loaded language

Through the use of emotionally charged language, a mood and attitude can be set without providing arguments, reasons or any considerations of alternate possibilities. Consider, for example, the difference between calling a change a "diversion of funds" and calling it a"reform"

###Euphenisms
Is the opposite of emotionally charged language

Euphenisms: on the other hand, involves a kind of whitewashing effect in which descriptions are less emotional than appropriate. 
* If a video store advertises tapes as“ pre-enjoyed ” ; that is a euphemism for “ secondhand. ”
* Bland, abstract, polite language is often used to refer to things that would be found embarrassing, demeaning, appalling, or horrible.
* Euphemistic language functions to desensitize us, to dull our awareness of such things.

##Ambiguity
Does 1, 2 imply 3
1. Grandma is sick
2. Fishing is not what it used to be, 
Therefore
3. Hotdogs are bettwe with ketchup

Well its because the two premieses having nothing to do with the conclusion.

Example of correct reasoning
1. Someone breathing is alive
2. joe is breathing, 
Therefore
3. joes is alive

It looks like the 3 sentences has something to do with each other, reoccuring ideas (notions) such as Joe, and breathing and being alive

There are two types of ambiguity

Semantic ambiguity

When we only read the headline, we do not have enough information to guide us to which meaning is intended, so the headline is ambiguous. This is an example of semantic ambiguity.

Example
* He could not spot the city on his map.
 * Spot as in see or find
* There was an ugly green spot on her shirt. 
 *  it refers to a mark on the shirt, presumably one that is dirt or soil and should not be there.

Syntatic ambiguity
* Other ambiguities are due to the structure of phrases or sentences — to the way words are put together. These ambiguities are called syntactic.

They arise because a phrase or sentence can quite naturally be interpreted as expressing two or more distinct gram  matical structures. 

Example
* A common cause of syntactic ambiguity is careless writing. An example of syntactic ambiguity is the previously mentioned headline “ Time for Football and Meatball Stew. ”
 * Here, word order, meaning, and reasonable charity in interpretation all indicate that the word meatball in this headline should describe the stew. There isnt football in the stew
 
Fallacy of equivocation 
*  A fallacy is a mistaken argument or step in argument that is often not noticed and, as a result, appears with some frequency. 
* The fallacy of equivocation is committed when a key word in an argument is used in two or more senses and the premises of the argument appear to support its conclusion only because these senses are not distinguished from each other. 
* We may fail to notice the shift in meaning, and for that reason think that the argument is more cogent than it is

1. Micah White is an atheist.
2. All atheists lack beliefs.
So,
3. Micah White lacks beliefs.
4. Anyone who lacks beliefs cannot be persecuted for his beliefs.
Therefore,
5. Micah White cannot be persecuted for his beliefs
